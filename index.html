				1.Cats spend much of their time grooming themselves, so you will rarely have to bathe your feline friend. Compared to dogs, cats tend to smell much better. Unlike dogs, your cat won’t go outside and roll in unpleasant things or pick a fight with a skunk. Because cats are so good at keeping themselves clean, they usually feel softer and cleaner than dogs and many other animals when you pet them.
				2.Kitties are much more self-sufficient than other pets, particularly dogs. Cats don’t need to be taken outside multiple times a day for bathroom and exercise walks. Cats also don’t require nearly as much training as dogs. Cats are also self-cleaning.

				1.This may be an exaggeration, but then again, that could be your reality. If you are eyeing a furry breed, its adorable fluffy self comes with the problematic shedding of fur. As a pet parent, the furs in your shirt, on the couch, all over your living room, under the bed and even the fur in your bed, is typical. Dogs love to freely lounge in unwelcome places and the couch or the bed will never be completely off limits. Maybe that crazy dog movie showing a wild pooch partying on the bed celebrating world domination behind your back is actually based on true-to-life story. You are then left to deal with the aftermath. To help address the issue, regular grooming of the dog is adequate. A good fur cleaning rake or gadget, that can easily be purchased from your friendly neighborhood pet store or online, would also do the trick.<br>

				2.Having a dog in the house is similar to having a toddler in the house. And just like taking care of a toddler, a dog especially a pup means loads of poop and pee. This is unavoidable particularly if you will allow the dog to sleep inside the house or until the dog becomes trained. In the first few weeks, the pungent aroma as you approach your living room will no longer be a surprise. The small smelly chunks scattered all over your living room floor will also be a normal spectacle.
